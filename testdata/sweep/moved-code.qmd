# References to Moved Code

This content references code that has been moved or deleted:

The likelihood computation can be found at:
[compute_likelihood.c lines 100-200](https://github.com/example/repo/blob/abc123/src/compute_likelihood.c#L100-L200)

This file was renamed in a refactoring, so the link is now broken.

Also see:
[deleted_file.c lines 50-100](https://github.com/example/repo/blob/def456/old/deleted_file.c#L50-L100)
